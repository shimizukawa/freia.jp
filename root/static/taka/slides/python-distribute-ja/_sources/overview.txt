The Python Packaging Ecosystem
==============================

If you're here looking for concise information on how to install
Python :term:`distributions <distribution>`, please see
:doc:`basic distribution installation <basics_installing_dists>`.
If you're looking for concise instructions for creating
and distributing *your own* distributions, please see
:doc:`basic distribution creation <basics_creating_distributing_dists>`.

To learn more general information about how the pieces of the Python
packaging ecosystem fit together, read on.

The Big Picture
===============

.. image:: images/overview.jpg

The Python packaging ecosystem consists of the following major
components:

Users
    Users **(5)** of Python who would like to install third-party modules
    (see :term:`distributions <distribution>` below) on their system.

Distributions
    Juicy and delicious third-party Python modules, ripe for the
    picking. ``:)`` See :term:`distribution`.

Python installations
    You might be using your system Python (the one that came installed
    on your OS), or you might have built and installed your own. Each
    Python installation can have its own set of installed
    distributions.

Virtual environments
    A Python installation will often have one or more named virtual
    environments set up (such that you can install distributions into
    the named environment rather than the Python installation
    itself). See :doc:`virtualenv` for more about virtual enviroments.
    They are very easy to set up, and the :doc:`basic distribution
    installation <basics_installing_dists>` doc walks you through it.

An Online Index of Distributions
    This is the :doc:`PyPI <pypi>`. Grand Central Station for Python
    distributions **(3)**.

PyPI Contributors
    Developers **(1)** creating distributions. It's quite easy to become
    one. Please see
    :doc:`basic distribution creation <basics_creating_distributing_dists>`
    to get started. Your work is appreciated---please contribute!

Tools for installing distributions
    We recommend using :doc:`pip` **(4)**.

Tools for creating and distributing distributions
    We recommend using :doc:`Distribute <distribute>` **(2)** (which---behind
    the scenes---uses the standard :doc:`distutils` module).
