    Buildout
        A `python-based build system <http://www.buildout.org>`_ for creating,
        assembling and deploying applications from multiple parts, any of
        which may be non-python based. It lets you create a buildout
        configuration and reproduce the same software later.
        
        Buildout is commonly used to install and manage Python distributions.
        It differentiates itself from :doc:`<pip>` in a few ways: Buildout
        takes a configuration file as input, where as pip is run from the 
        command-line. Buildout can run any arbitrary recipe during installation
        and so can manage non-python parts, such as config files, databases,
        etc. Buildout by default installs packages in a multi-version manner, 
        so that each distribution is contained in a separate directory, and 
        Buildout be configured so that other Buildout installations can re-use
        a multi-version archive of installed distributions. In contrast, Pip
        installs distributions into a single location, such that it's only
        possible to have a single version of each distribution installed at
        a time. However, it's possible to use different recipes with Buildout
        to create single location installations in the same fashion as pip.

    CPAN
        CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a large collection of
        :term:`Perl` software and documentation. You can begin exploring from
        either http://www.cpan.org/, http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ or any of the
        mirrors listed at http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html. [CPAN]_

    Developer
        The person developing the package.

    Distribution
        A Python distribution is a versioned compressed archive file
        that contains Python packages, modules, and other resource
        files. The distribution file is what an end-user will download
        from the internet and install.
        
        A distribution is often also called a package. This is the term
        commonly used in other fields of computing. For example, Mac OS X
        and Debian call these files package files. However, in Python, the
        term package refers to an importable directory. In order to
        distinguish between these two concepts, the compressed archive file
        containing code is called a distribution.
        
        However, it is not uncommon in Python to refer to a distribution
        using the term package. While the two meanings of the term package
        is not always 100% unambigous, the context of the term package is
        usually sufficient to distinguish the meaning of the word. For
        example, the python installation tool pip is an acronym for
        "pip installs packages", while technically the tool installs
        distributions, the name package is used as it's meaning is more
        widely understood. Even the site where distributions are distributed
        at is called the Python Package Index (and not the Python Distribution
        Index).

    Distutils
        A standard and basic package that comes with the Python
        standard library. It is used for creating distributions
        (where it is imported in the ``setup.py`` file for that
        distribution).

    Extension Module
        A module written in the low-level language of the Python
        implementation: C/C++ for Python, Java for Jython. Typically
        contained in a single dynamically loadable pre-compiled file, e.g.
        a shared object (.so) file for Python extensions on Unix, a DLL
        (given the .pyd extension) for Python extensions on Windows, or a
        Java class file for Jython extensions.

    IRC
        Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a form of real-time Internet text messaging
        (chat) or synchronous conferencing. It is mainly designed for group
        communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows
        one-to-one communication via private message as well as chat and data
        transfers via Direct Client-to-Client. [WikipediaIRC]_

    Known Good Set (KGS)
        A set of distributions at specified versions which are compatible with
        each other. Typically a test suite will be run which passes all
        tests before a specific set of packages is declared a known good
        set. This term is commonly used by frameworks and toolkits which
        are compromised of multiple individual distributions.
    
    Module
        A python source code file (ex. ``mymodule.py``), most often
        found in a package (``mypackage/mymodule.py``). You can import
        a module: ``import mymodule``, or ``import mypackage.mymodule``
        if it lives in ``mypackage``.

    Package
        A directory containing an ``__init__.py`` file (ex.
        ``mypackage/__init__.py``), and also usually containing
        modules (possibly along with other packages). You can import
        a package: ``import mypackage``

        A package should not be confused with a compressed archive file
        used to install Python code.

    Package Index
        A repository of distributions with a web interface to automate
        distribution discovery and consumption.

        .. seealso:: The :ref:`pypi_info` is the default packaging
                     index for the Python community. It is open to all
                     Python developers to consume and distribute their
                     distributions.

    Packager
        The person packaging the package for a particular operating system
        (e.g. Debian).

    Perl
        Perl is a high-level programming language with an eclectic heritage
        written by Larry Wall and a cast of thousands. It derives from the
        ubiquitous C programming language and to a lesser extent from sed, awk,
        the Unix shell, and at least a dozen other tools and languages. Perl's
        process, file, and text manipulation facilities make it particularly
        well-suited for tasks involving quick prototyping, system utilities,
        software tools, system management tasks, database access, graphical
        programming, networking, and world wide web programming. These strengths
        make it especially popular with system administrators and CGI script
        authors, but mathematicians, geneticists, journalists, and even managers
        also use Perl. [PERL]_

    Pip
        :doc:`<pip>` is a command-line tool for downloading and installing
        Python distributions.

    Project
        A library, framework, script, plugin, application, or collection of
        data or other resources, or some combination thereof.

        Python projects must have unique names, which are registered on 
        PyPI. Each project will then contain one or more releases, and
        each release may comprise one or more distributions.

        Note that there is a strong convention to name a project after the
        name of the package that is imported to run that project. However,
        this doesn't have to hold true. It's possible to install a distribution
        from the project 'spam' and have it provide a package importable only
        as 'eggs'.

    Pure Python Module
        A module written in Python and contained in a single .py file
        (and possibly associated .pyc and/or .pyo files). Sometimes referred
        to as a "pure module."

    Release
        A snapshot of a project at a particular point in time, denoted by a
        version identifier.
        
        Making a release may entail the publishing of multiple distributions.
        For example, if version 1.0 of a project was released, it could be
        available in both a source distribution format and a Windows
        installer distribution format.

    reStructuredText
        A plain text format used in many Python projects for documentation. The
        reStructuredText format is used in this document. For more information,
        please see the `reStructuredText Documentation 
        <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.

    Standard Library
        Python's standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of
        facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The
        library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to
        system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be
        inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python
        that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in
        everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to
        encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting
        away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs. [StandardLibrary]_

        .. seealso:: `Python Standard Library Documentation
           <http://docs.python.org/library/>`_

    System Package
        A package provided by in a format native to the operating system.
        e.g. rpm or dpkg file.
        
    Tarball
        An archive format for collected a group of files together as one. The
        format's extension is usually ``.tar``, which represents its meaning,
        Tape ARchive. The format is often used in conjunction with a
        compression format such as gzip or bzip. 

    Working Set
        A collection of distributions available for importing. These are the
        distributions that are on the `sys.path` variable. At most one
        version a distribution is possible in a working set.

        Working sets include all distributions available for importing, not
        just the sub-set of distributions which have actually been imported.
